Optimizing cost vs. nutrtrient intake for soldiers in the U.S. Military in 1943. 

For this project will be using the PuLP library to create a Linear Programming problem with the following constraints:

- Each nutrient (vitamin A, Sodium, Fiber, etc.) has a minimum and maximum safe consumption amount.
- No one wants to eat both frozen broccoli and celery as this would be cruel and unusual
- Meat/Poultry/Fish/Eggs should appear in the diet 3 times a day
- A serving size should be at least one full serving
